mergecam
========

MergeCam takes video sources and combines them into a single panoramic video. The calibration can be performed automatically using interest point detection or using manually selected points. Local USB cameras or remote MJPEG IP cameras may be used as input sources. The output can be streamed to another app for video conferencing or remote monitoring. MergeCam Pro can save the output to a compressed video file.
