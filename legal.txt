7	LIMITED WARRANTY

7.1	Subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set out below, the Licensor warrants that for a period of 90 days from the date of delivery of the Materials (the " Warranty Period"), the Medium on which the Materials are recorded will be free from material defects under normal use and the copy of the Materials in the package will materially conform to the documentation that accompanies it.

7.2	The Licensor will also indemnify you for personal injury or death directly resulting from any defect in its products or the negligence of its employees.

7.3	The Licensor shall not be liable under the warranties given in clause 7.1 above if the Materials fail to conform to the said warranty because of any corruption, abuse or incorrect use of the Materials (including use of the Materials with equipment or other software which is incompatible) or because of any variation, modification or addition to the Materials not performed by the Licensor.

8	DISCLAIMER

	All other guarantees, representations and warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or ability to achieve a particular result are hereby excluded, so far as such exclusion or disclaimer is permitted under the applicable law. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Materials. Should the Materials prove defective, you (and not the Licensor nor any licensed reseller) assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. The Licensor does not warrant that the Materials will meet your requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or error free. This Licence Agreement does not affect your statutory rights.

9	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

If the Medium or the Materials fail to conform to the warranties set out in clause 7.1 above you may, as your sole and exclusive remedy, obtain a replacement if you return the Materials to the Licensor or to your supplier during the Warranty Period with a dated proof of purchase.

10.2	Nothing in this Licence Agreement shall exclude or limit the liability of the Licensor for fraudulent misrepresentation or for death or personal injury resulting from the negligence of the Licensor.

11	TERMINATION

11.1	This Licence Agreement will terminate automatically if you breach of any of its terms or if you destroy the Materials and any copies or return the Materials to the Licensor or your supplier voluntarily.

11.2	Upon termination all rights you have to use the Materials will cease and you must destroy or delete the Materials and all copies from all storage media in your control.
